Statistical Analysis of Acetylene Reduction Assay

Aim to analyse data generated with Agilent GC-FID technology.
Data generated thanks to these machines are arranged in a tree, the root 
being named after the experiment name choosen by the user at the 
begenning of the run. This folder contains several log files, 
configuration files and metadata files, as well as a folder for each 
sample analysed. The folder name is composed of a three digit number, 
that corresponds to the sample number in the run, the letter "B", a four 
digit number that is the concatenation of the vial number and '01' and 
eventually the string ".D". Everything concatenated without blank 
spaces.
